We have initially tried to create an exponent function and have used '^' symbol for it. However, in Rust '^' expression is used for bitwise XOR.

In this code, we find the bitwise XOR of 4 and 3. 

4 in binary is 100 

3 in binary is 011

Bitwise XOR of 4 and  3 => 1 xor 1 || 0 xor 1 || 0 xor 1 (where || is the concatenation symbol)

which results in 111. The decimal representation of 111 is 7, which is the output we get when we compile the code and run the output. 

Note: The file named 'bitXOR' with no extension is the output we get after compiling the code.
